# license-to-vim

This is a simple Vim plugin that gives you the license to license your code.
You can insert a license right into your code without leaving Vim!

Don't see the license you want?
Open an issue and I'd be happy to add it.

To insert the full text of a license under the cursor, enter `:License('mit')` (or whichever you choose).
Some licenses require that license stubs be inserted at the top of files.
For applicable licenses, you can get the stub using `:Stub('agpl')` (or whichever).
